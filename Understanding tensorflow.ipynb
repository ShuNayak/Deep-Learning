    "Tensorflow was not specifically built for neural networks, it is more generally an architecture for executing a graph of numerical operations.\n",
    "You can have any sequence of operations and have a graph of how those operations fit together.\n",
    "Tensorflow optimizes the processing by distributing it on various cores of your GPU, or various machines on a network.\n",
    "Runs on anything.\n",
    "So you can train the model, put the weights in the machines you want to run it on. So train the model offline and then push it to the machine of your choice. Tensorflow is written in C++ with easy to use Python APIs(interface).\n",

    "f = a+b    , f is a graph here, it doesnt put a+b value in f, it just establishes relationship between a and be and thier dependency on graph f. Nothing happens until we invoke 'f'. So that will distribute this extremely complicated task (:-D) across the cluster and finally we have the new tensor which is 3.\n",
